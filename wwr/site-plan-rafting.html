    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this Website is to build buiness revenu. This means I'll be looking to persuade people to not only
    come look at the website, but also to pique their interest into potentially going to go white water rafting. To do this I would have to
    make the website look fun. My first thought is to add bring colors, like  orange, light blue or green, with pictures of kids and adults 
    having fun. 
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>While I would hope to get the attention of anyone who is looking to go a little outside their comfortzone,
    (like a wannabe daredevil,) I think it would be smart to attract families, especially kids. I would try to target the idea 
    of saving money and creating memories so that its more appealing to the parents and gets the attention of college students who can't 
    make a lot of money but want to feel like they aren't just "boring nerds."
    I would try to make the website more appealing for the youth, but try to add some extra pizzaz for adults so that college students don't feel like this buisness is for children.
    I would have to make the website easy to use so that grandparents or young kids can use it, easy to read. Also adding sales or noting when there will be sales could help attract not only 
    college students, but parents who need to save money and want to create memories.

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
