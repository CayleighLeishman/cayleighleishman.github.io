        <div id="paragraph2">
            <h1>Should I bring my own badding/thread/materials? </h1>
           <p>The only things you need to bring are your quilt bottom, quilt top and yourself. 
            If you have a preference please call us to see if that is something that can
            be accomodated

            <h1>How long will it take?
            </h1>
            <p>It’s important to have your quilt back in your hands as soon as possible. Often you will have your quilt back in a number of days.

        <!--question5-->
        <div id="paragraph5">
            <h1>Are there any materials you cannot use on your machine?  </h1>
            <p>Fabrics like leather or really any material that stretches easily may damage the machine or ruin your hard work. Leather is too tough for the needles I have and stretchy materials may be difficult to work with. If you are unsure if it's too stretchy, please reach out to us for confirmation so we can give you a direct answer.
