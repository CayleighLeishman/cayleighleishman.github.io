    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Are you tired of people not knowing how to contact you? Wanting people to know more about your business, but youâ€™re tired of explaining yourself? 
        Well, Darci Rollingson has this issue, so I plan to make her a website where she can introduce herself and her business. She is a long-arm quilter, 
        which means people bring her the top part, their finished quilt tops and a bottom piece and ask her to add a finishing touch to their soon-to-be-new quilt.
        This finishing touch adds extravagant patterns like flowers, zebra stripes, and many more. This website would allow people to see some of the many quilts 
        she has done and figure out if she would be the best fit for them. This website would include an introduction page on Darci Rollingson, pictures of
        some of her finished work, and list ways to contact her. </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The intended audience for this assignment are people who would be buying Darci's business. Darci has a 
        long-arm quilt machine, which is a very expensive machine that is used to add extravagant threaded 
        patterns onto quilts. Doing patterns by hand the way the machine does would take months compared to
        the three to five hours it takes for the machine to do it. The focus target audience would
        most likely be women, especially women who have made their top and bottom peices of the quilts and want to add
        a finishing touch to their patterns.
